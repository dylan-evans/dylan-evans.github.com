<h1> {{page.title}} </h1>
<p>Like all good tech heads i have a pile strange looking computers and a 
girlfriend who often tells me - at length - that it's time to get rid of them. 
I love my computers, but it really is hard to justify the practical value of a 10+
year old dinosaur when a cheap PC worth a couple of hundred dollars can easily
out class a formerly top of the line server. In fact a whole rack can be replaced 
by just one such computer sliced in virtual machines. However i once held these 
computers in awe, and despite becoming obsolete they never fail to stir the 
childish excitement in me. My arguments are not based on practical merit, 
but instead on a deeper nostalgia.</p>

<p>Here are some of my favourite machines which do nothing.</p>

<div class="old_stuff">
<h2>Sun Sparc Station 5</h2>
<img src="/images/inventory/sparcstation20.jpeg" alt="Sparc Station 5" />
<p>I brought this about ten years ago and despite being outperformed by my phone
many, many, times over, it remains my favourite. There is something about old
sparcs, perhaps because they are a little exotic beside my old PCs,
maybe it's the mystery of exploring a system with weird sbus interface and
framebuffer card, which i never used. What is certain is that these machines
were built for quality, from the RISC architecture to the scsi drives it is
as reliable as the day it left the factory. It is a dying breed of computer
designed to last for decades, the philosophy of an older generation which
doesn't fit into the modern disposable world.
</p>

<p>When i brought this i also had a Sparc Station 2, both sat on my local
network running netbsd, not doing much, since at the time i was on dialup
and it was a little impractical running a home server. Briefly one of them
acted as a dialup router and ran a development version of SDFMud where myself
and occassional vistors worked on a branch of the game. This particular machine 
had a 110MHz processor and was a beast in it's time, but i never had an opportunity 
to use it to it's potential.
</p>

<p><i>Note: I was convinced this was a sparc station 20 until i glanced at
it while writing this blog. :-)</i></p>

<div class="old_stuff">
<h2>Sun Netra X1</h2>
<img src="/images/inventory/netra_x1.jpeg" alt="Sun Netra X1" />
Not as cool as the Sparc Station the netra was always a budget machine aimed
at the low end web server market. However it is a 64bit UltraSparc, a platform
which makes x86 look like an abacus. Even a cheap sparc (although sun has a
different idea of cheap than i do) puts a similar PC to shame with it's
efficiently designed RISC architecture. Sadly i have never really used this
machine, except as a web server for a brief time and so it is in my pile of
obsolete hardware.

<div class="old_stuff">
<h2>Dell Power Edge 2750</h2>
<img src="/images/inventory/dell.jpeg" alt="Dell PowerEdge 2750" />
<p>A true multi processor machine the Power Edge 2750 came with duel 2.4 Ghz Xeon 
processors and 5 hotswap 73GB scsi drives. I have always been obsessed with multi 
processors, despite having a dual core desktop at the time, it spoke of the power
of a true unix machine which i once dreamed about. 
</p>
<p>
I experimented with solaris at first, setting up zones and managing the disk array
with the brilliant ZFS. But when i started using it as an actual server i decided
to install debian so i could transfer my existing OpenVZ containers to it. For 6
months i ran the server in my office until i just couldn't deal 
with the noise anymore, i tried ducting and removing fans but in the end had
to bow to the fact that it was meant for the server room. I think the high pitch
whining kept me on edge for the entire time i operated it, and in the end
turning it off was like a zen meditation.

<div class="old_stuff">
<h2>Thin Clients</h2>
<img src="/images/inventory/thinclients.jpeg" alt="Thinclient collection" />
<p>The thinclients i brought as an experiment in running a low power server
with bare-bones hardware. I used the pair of compaqs as file servers, running
debian with an external hard drive. I Couldn't write the flash of
the T20, so it booted over the network from the T5520 (which first sent it a 
wake-on-lan). Despite fitting the very geeky definition of cool it was sluggish
and after about nine months, they became more a source of frustration than
admiration. I simply copied the file systems into OpenVZ machines and now
they sit with the rest of my old gear, being pulled out from time to time
as i consider some possible use for them.</p>

<p> The WYSE 1200LE i have never used, it sure is cute though.</p>

<h2>Others</h2>
<img src="/images/inventory/eee_and_isa.jpeg" alt="Other computers" />
<p>I believe that the eee PC was designed to be obsolete, this one is the trend 
setting 701 and i am surprised they caught on at all. The slow processor, tiny 
keyboard, small low res screen and difficult touch pad make the machine very difficult to
use. I had hoped that it would be a convenient substitute for lugging around
a big laptop, but it is such a chore to use i found myself avoiding it, using it
only as a last resort. In fact as soon as i brought it i went for a trip to New
Zealand thinking i would do an assignment on it, big mistake.
</p>
<p>I have recently been considering using it as a dhcp and nat server to take 
the load off my sluggish router. As awkward as the little machine is, it has 
a future (so long as i don't have to use the keyboard). It is a cool computer 
with it's small size, solid state drive and upgraded 2GB RAM, it has everything
you can expect from a modern computer... in miniture.

</p>

<p>I brought the Mini-ITX with the belief that i would install it in my car. This
has not yet happened. It has an 800Mhz VIA Cyrix processor and is pictured with 
512MB RAM installed. It is quite a capable PC and i used it as a diskless X server
for awhile before debian (or Xorg) pulled the Cyrix driver out.
