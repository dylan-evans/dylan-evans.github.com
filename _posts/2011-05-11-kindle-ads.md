title: The Ad Supported Kindle
---
# {{page.title}}
Amazon has recently released an Ad supported edition of the wifi Kindle enticing
buyers with a $25 discount. The Kindle screensaver becomes an Ad or offer instead
of the images of distinguished authors and a small ad is included beneath the book
list. Not particularly intrusive and any discount would be better spent on actual
books, it has received generally positive reviews.

My previous Kindle (prior to it's untimely demise) was an incredibly elegant device.
Providing the freedom of
an entire library in the palm of the hand, with the simple interface and wireless
connection the Kindle has a purpose, with an almost meditative peacefulness.
It seems somehow wrong to have ads on it, like eating a big-mac in
a buddhist temple or yelling in a library, it may have all the function
of a regular kindle but amazon is right to reduce the price because it is worth less.
The shear knowledge that the reader has been invaded by direct marketing, which
will doubtlessly become targeted based upon book selections, devalues it.

The Kindle is a rare gem of technology. The Nook appears to be turning into
a general purpose tablet and other readers suffer from the lack of integration
with such a large ebook provider. It would be sad to see the device become a
marketing tool.
