# Roboball
I have always been fascinated by writing robots which compete with each other, 
so while i was studying python at university i began work on a game called
"botball" where robots running in real time would compete in a football like
game. I released it to my fellow class mates to a resounding lack of interest,
but i guess most of them were struggling with the basics.

##Rational
Most of the robot games i have encountered have revolved around a virtual 
masacre were scripts shoot, destroy and annihilate each other. Now don't get
me wrong i play Call of Duty and love it but the idea that casual robot
development is aimed at creating ever increasingly efficient and devious
routines to kill each other is a little disturbing. This is artificial 
intelligence after all and when the time comes to start booting android it may
be that the most developed code is loaded with battle strategies. I don't think
that would end well.

## The Game 
The game is played on a field which is a rectangular grid with a goal at each 
end. Each team has an intial side which they must defend while attempting to 
move the ball to the other goal. Each bot may move or kick the ball in any of
8 directions being horizontal, vertical or diagonal.
