# RoboBall
Robot games are cool! Which is why when i studied python at university i wrote 
a game called botball in which (virtual) robots written in python would vie for
glory on a (virtual) football field and all in real time. After a weekend of
exploring python i released the game to my fellow classmates to a resounding
lack of interest. I believe many of the students were not prepared for writing
threaded football playing robots, in fact, due to a mistake in which the course
had no prerequisites, many of them were not prepared to write a hello world.
Discouraged by the awkward silence in my forum thread i shelved the project 
and moved on.


##Rationale
Destroying the world: many have tried, programmers will succeed. I've seen
enough apocolypse movies to know that AI will destroy us all, and yet most
of the robot games i have seen revolve around combat where programmers 
create ever more clever and efficient methods for reaping destruction. Don't get
me wrong, i'm not a pacifist, i play Call of Duty and love it, but somehow 
training the next generation of killer robots seems like a bad idea.

So what attributes would you like to see when you are facing a steel framed 
monster android of the future? Co-operation? Team Work? In RoboBall the robot
is actually a team of 8 robots working together to solve the complex problem of
getting the ball past the other team and into the goal.

## The Game 
The game is played on a field which is comprised of a rectangular grid with 
a goal at each end. Each team has an initial side which they must defend while attempting to 
move the ball to the other goal. Each bot may move or kick the ball in any of
8 directions being horizontal, vertical or diagonal.

## The Rules
_These numbers are not final and are only intended for illustration_
* The field is a grid of 16 by 65
* 8 Robots on each team
* The game consists of 10 rounds, with each team starting with the ball 5 times
* A point is scored when a robot kicks or carries a ball into the opposite goal
* A foul is scored when the ball is kicked or carried off the field at any other point
* A round ends when a point or foul is scored
* The winner is the player with the most points and, in case of a tie, the least fouls
