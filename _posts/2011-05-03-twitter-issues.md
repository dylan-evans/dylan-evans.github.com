Twitter is not the first message protocol to hit the internet, however the
indisputable popularity of the simple micro-blogging format, which tends toward
a mix of instant messaging and forum posting, is the form of social media that
people have been dreaming about. Topics, trends and followers form communities
not bound by location but instead by common interest in an increasingly digital
world. As a form of communication Twitter is comparable to email which is often
used for public posting either through a mailing list or through news groups
which act similar to hashtagging in order to syndicate a message.
Email has been the backbone of internet communication since the beginning, passed
between disconnected servers with UUCP (Unix to Unix Copy Protocol) and distributed
through usenet long before the web was even conceived.

The technology used to pass email follows the pattern of how the internet actually
works, while some email servers may be experiencing difficulty others continue to
pass messages with ease, and during times of communication difficulties email is
simply spooled so that communications can resume seemlessly. Mail protocols are
designed to be robust and consider the unreliable nature of the network. Twitter
however not so much, regular twitter users will have experienced disruptions
caused by an excess of traffic or some other unseen calamity. The unfortunate
matter is that twitter is not itself a protocol which can be routed around
problematic servers bypassing overloaded servers. Instead it is a
service bound to the resources of the company which controls it, and without
indulging in conspiracy theories it is governed by a commercial entity
instead of driven by community needs and open development, if it does
not prove to be profitable it can easily be switched off.

Twitter may last forever, but when considering the direction of the internet and
where we may be in 10 or 20 years it seems unlikely that such a simple form of
communication will exist as part of a closed private entity. Although with the
popularity of services and the social web perhaps the internet itself will be
changed into a commercial model. However benefits of using a protocol instead of a
service seem too important to ignore.
