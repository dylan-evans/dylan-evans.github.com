IE & Design
===========
After studying IT at university i learnt very little about actual design,
and assumed that the profession was for flamboyant lady-boys who didn't
have a good grasp on algebra and art students who sold out to buy pot.
However after working on a couple of sites since (including this one) 
i am willing to concede that i may have been mistaken and have made
some observations about design.

* Design is really hard
  > It's very easy to slap some text on a web page and call it a day, but
  > creating something which actually looks appealing is a nightmare, add
  > a simple little change like drop shadows and the page starts to look 
  > horrible without it. Create an appealing contrast of colours then add
  > a highlight which ruins everything. And on a simple page there are 
  > hundreds of these little changes.

* Internet Explorer makes web design both impossible and fun
  > Every version of IE is just plain ridiculous, your page will look
  > fantastic in every other browser but will be completely broken
  > in IE, now you just have to figure out why. And for some of us
  > fixing things is fun, so thank you Microsoft, you may have ruined
  > the internet but you have given us a good puzzle.

* Nothing is as satisfying as seeing your work complete.
  > Actually having something to sit back and look at gives you a sense
  > of real achievment, you can print it, frame it and stare at it all
  > night if you're so inclined. Nothing like writing a script on a server
  > which does some background processing no one ever knows about, sure
  > you know it's brilliant and everyone who reads it will be stunned,
  > but somehow that drive which has fueled master craftsman for centuries
  > is missing. With design there is a more tangible result.

So it seems i actually like the design process and it is not terribly
defferent from the code-debug cycle of programming. Tinkering with visual
elements in basic is what really sparked my interest in programming a long
time ago so perhaps it isn't so surprising that i really enjoy creating web
sites.

# Extended digression on IE
What were they thinking? I remember about ten years ago when developers
would create a site for IE and simply exclude all other browsers. Thankfully
that practice not only didn't catch on but Microsoft has recieved a backlash
from developers for not being standards compliant. It is difficult to 
comprehend the goals of IE, it breaks most standards, does not provide a
superior platform for developers, falls behind in user experience and
has has a very colourful history of security flaws and bugs. If it had not
been microsoft i think IE would have just been pushed aside.
