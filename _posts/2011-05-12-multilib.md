title: Missing Multilib

# {{ page.title }}
A quick tip for anyone receiving the error:

    /usr/include/gnu/stubs.h:7:27: error: gnu/stubs-32.h: No such file or directory

This indicates that gcc multilib is not properly installed. Stop scratching your head
and install the debian packages 'gcc-multilib', and for C++ 'g++-multilib'. Names
may vary under other distros but this will serve as a good starting point.

Multilib is used on amd64 platforms to compile and run 32 bit x86 applications
which for some technical reason cannot handle the 64 bit architecture.
