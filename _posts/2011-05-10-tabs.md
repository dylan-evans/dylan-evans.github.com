The tabs versus spaces war has been raging for as long as anyone can remember,
with programmers often being forced into a style which is unfamiliar and
uncomfortable. For myself their was no debate in the beginning, C on unix was
clearly tab country and while now often disputed, with newer projects seemingly
preferring spaces, strictly styled code in large projects like the linux kernel
keep tabs alive.

After being a stalwart tab aficionado to the extent of losing marks at university,
the move to dynamic languages saw me finally shift preferences to 4 spaces
yielding to the convention of the day. However even with the dust still settling
from the battles and
skirmishes still common on forums and mailing lists the trend of using just 2
spaces seems to be gaining ground. Clearly the world has gone mad, and yet 'joe',
an old favourite editor, seems to now default to just 2 spaces for many formats.

Perhaps it would be a little smug to note that most editors can be configured to
display tabs with any width and that the simplest solution to differing preferences
could be to take a step back and view code as a simple logical structure which can
easily be reformatted by the magic of editors. But someone will probably just come
up with a unicode INDENT character instead.
