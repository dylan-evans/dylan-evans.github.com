# Open Source Vs. Money
A conviction in open-source software becomes difficult to maintain when money
is on the table. I have never had much trouble with this however at
dinner a couple of days ago i was showing off my little android wallpaper app 
which i wrote just to check out the platform. It was always my intention to 
make it 
stable and release it with the source (of course, of course), it was fun 
writing it, and i would have been pretty happy just to have one or two people 
check it out.

However my faith was suddenly shaken when someone told me exactly how it could 
be sold for a profit, an excellent idea that would never have occurred to me. 
Being a famous open source developer, i imagine, with all the oppertunities the
industry has to offer, it would seem like a pretty absurd notion selling this
mere novelty, however as a run of the mill programmer with the bills and the
threat the economy places on our heads those dollar signs are pretty enticing.
I began to wonder if maybe my lack of marketing prowess is all that's holding 
me back, how strong is my conviction really? Many programmers aspire to
principles which, while lofty and noble, may leave us with empty pockets while
the ideas behind the project are hijacked by some commercial interest.

I suppose i will hold on to the idea for a little longer, but in the end i 
suspect that the effort to sell it will not be worth the reward, and the 
selling will form the bulk of the work, not at all what i want. I just want to
code eh?
