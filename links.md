#Links
------
A rough collection of links i have found useful, certainly and inevitably incomplete.

##Icons and Images
* [Open Icon Library](http://openiconlibrary.sourceforge.net/ "Open icons")
  > Very nice set of all purpose icons
* [Open ClipArt](http://www.openclipart.org/ "Open clip art")
  > A massive collection of community contributed clipart available under the
  > creative commons license. 

##Web Design
* [25 Rounded Corner Techniques with CSS](http://www.devwebpro.com/25-rounded-corners-techniques-with-css/)
  > Many ideas
* [Curvy Corners](http://www.curvycorners.net/)
  > The javascript hack (used on this site) which provides CSS3 style rounded
  > conrners in browsers which don't support it.
