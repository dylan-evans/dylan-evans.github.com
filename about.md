## Credits
Here is a non-exhaustive list of resources which have helped me create this
site.

## Github Bloggers
Thankfully every other github blogger writes a blog entry or article about how 
they created their site. These are an invaluable resource and while i have read
many more, here are some of the sites i bookmarked.

[Getting started with GitHub Pages](http://xlson.com/2010/11/09/getting-started-with-github-pages.html)
> Great little introduction.

[The switch to Github Pages](http://sirupsen.com/the-switch-to-github-pages/)
> Simon Hørup Eskildsen's minimalist blog: This explains Simon's reason for switching.

## Resources
[css3pie](http://css3pie.com)

## Tools
