# Welcome to {{ page.title }}
=============================

The thing i find wierd about working on github like this is the fact that 
every little detail is open, and permanently so. I'm accustomed to keeping
code and working details private, where on github i feel like i am throwing
the front door to my house open and going to bed with an open invite for 
anyone passing by to poke around in my kitchen and, oh i don't know, offer
to improve the stir-fry they found in the fridge. 

I guess i have always thought of code as being a private thing which i
mostly keep to myself where i am free to make silly mistakes, perhaps without
even noticing. The obvious problem is that while this may be very safe it
is not at all constructive and it becomes all to easy to write code and forget
about it which is a waste of time. I've always been impressed with people who
can allow a cleaner into their bedroom, this is a private space, and yet they
are inviting a stranger to go through thier stuff. For me github is that
cleaner and the challenge for me is to let go of this private space which is
my code, and perhaps even become a very public space where it can actually
serve some purpose. I think this is a good thing.
